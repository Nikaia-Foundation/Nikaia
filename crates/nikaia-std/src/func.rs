//! **A function value that is kept**: in a field, a result, a `let`, or a
//! parameter the callee stores (Part II 12.3's handlers, Part I 5.3).
//!
//! A parameter the callee only runs is a closure argument and never reaches
//! here. One that is kept needs a type a struct can hold, so it is one shared
//! closure: `Kept<dyn Fn(A) -> R>`, cloned by a count, printed as `<fn>`, and
//! called as the closure it holds. A function type that may pause keeps a
//! closure returning a [`Boxed`] future.
